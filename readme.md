Created by Ryozuki with the help of timakro.

##How it Works
The goal of this gamemode is to hammer others on the spikes or out of the map.
When you hammer a tee, the knockback strength against that tee increases (the strength is indicated with the skin color).

The hearts decrease your knockback and the shields protect you against adding knockback from 1 hit.
